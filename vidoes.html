                        <h2>Understanding DOM & Creating a Website Layout</h2>
                        <p>This video is a part of my JavaScript In Hindi Course. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

                            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the best and most demanded technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is a crucial part of web applications. The vast majority of sites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine in order to execute it.
                            
                            As a multi-paradigm language, it supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming fashion. It has APIs for dealing with text, arrays, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host machine environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.</p>
